Building:  
first you must install KivEnt - at the time of writing you must use my gl_polygen branch.  
here https://github.com/Kovak/chozabu/tree/gl_polygen

polygon2 is required  
sudo pip install polygon  


if you wish to compile for android probably should install libatlas3-base (on ubuntu) as the default has processor-specific instructions.  

Also - there should be a recent (probably working) build here: http://chozabu.net/KivEntEdLatest.apk
