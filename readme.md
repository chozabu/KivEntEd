Building:  
first you must install KivEnt - at the time of writing you must use my 3d_rendering branch.  
here https://github.com/chozabu/KivEnt/tree/3d_rendering

polygon2 is required  
sudo pip install polygon  

 

Also - there should be a recent (probably working) android build here: http://chozabu.net/KivEntEdLatest.apk
