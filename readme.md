Building:  
first you must install KivEnt - at the time of writing you must use the gl_polygen branch.  
here https://github.com/Kovak/KivEnt/tree/gl_polygen or here https://github.com/chozabu/KivEnt/tree/polyphys

polygon2 is required  
sudo pip install polygon  


if you wish to compile for android probably should install libatlas3-base (on ubuntu) as the default has processor-specific instructions.
